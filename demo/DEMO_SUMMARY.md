A comprehensive demonstration of a complete agent marketplace system with all 8 lifecycle stages implemented and working.

## Demo Components

### üéØ Core Demo (`marketplace_demo.py`)
- **3 Docker-based agents** with realistic implementations
- **2 customer accounts** with separate instances and billing
- **Interactive progression** through all 8 lifecycle stages
- **Real-time monitoring** of resources, health, and costs
- **Automatic cleanup** of all resources

### üöÄ Easy Runners
- **`run_demo.py`** - Python runner with requirement checking
- **`setup.sh`** - Environment setup and dependency installation
- **`run_demo.sh`** - One-command setup and demo execution

### üìö Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Complete setup and usage instructions
- **`requirements.txt`** - All necessary Python dependencies
- **`DEMO_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## What It Demonstrates

### ‚úÖ Complete Lifecycle Management
All 8 stages of the agent lifecycle are implemented and demonstrated:
1. **Registration** - Docker agent registration with metadata
2. **Discovery** - Marketplace browsing with pricing and availability
3. **Instantiation** - Customer-specific instance creation
4. **Active/Running** - Task execution with real results
5. **Monitoring** - Resource usage, health, and billing tracking
6. **Pause/Resume** - Cost-saving pause/resume functionality
7. **Termination** - Graceful shutdown with final billing
8. **Deregistration** - Safe removal with data preservation

### ‚úÖ Production-Ready Features
- **Customer Isolation** - Each customer has separate instances
- **Real-Time Billing** - Cost tracking with multiple pricing models
- **Resource Monitoring** - CPU, memory, network, and task tracking
- **Health Monitoring** - Connection status and error tracking
- **Docker Integration** - Full container lifecycle management
- **ACP Protocol** - Agent Communication Protocol implementation
- **API Security** - Bearer token authentication
- **Database Persistence** - SQLite with proper data modeling

### ‚úÖ Realistic Scenarios
- **3 Agent Types**: Analytics, NLP, and Creative with different capabilities
- **Sample Tasks**: Real-world examples like data analysis, text processing, image generation
- **Customer Workflows**: Registration ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí Instantiation ‚Üí Usage ‚Üí Management
- **Cost Optimization**: Pause/resume to save money during idle periods
- **Performance Tracking**: Resource usage and billing analytics

## Technical Validation

### üê≥ Docker Integration
- **Container Management**: Start, stop, pause, resume, remove
- **Image Building**: Automatic Docker image creation for agents
- **Network Management**: Isolated networking with port allocation
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring

### üîÑ ACP Protocol Implementation
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication
- **HTTP Fallback**: Compatibility with simple agents
- **Message Types**: Handshake, task execution, heartbeat, status updates
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and health monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error reporting

### üìä Monitoring & Analytics
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage tracking
- **Performance Tracking**: Task execution time and success rates
- **Cost Analytics**: Real-time billing with multiple pricing models
- **Health Monitoring**: Agent health status and error counting
- **Usage Statistics**: Instance uptime and task count tracking

## Business Value Demonstrated

### üë• For Customers
- **Easy Discovery**: Browse agents with pricing and performance data
- **Flexible Deployment**: Create instances with custom configurations
- **Cost Control**: Pause/resume functionality for cost optimization
- **Real-Time Visibility**: Monitor usage, costs, and performance
- **Reliable Service**: Health monitoring and error handling

### üîß For Agent Developers
- **Simple Registration**: Easy Docker-based agent deployment
- **Automatic Management**: Container lifecycle handled automatically
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and health status
- **Flexible Pricing**: Multiple pricing models supported
- **Scalable Architecture**: Instance-based model supports growth

### üè¢ For Platform Operators
- **Complete Lifecycle**: All 8 stages implemented and monitored
- **Customer Isolation**: Secure multi-tenant architecture
- **Revenue Tracking**: Real-time billing and cost analytics
- **Operational Monitoring**: Health, performance, and usage metrics
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Docker-based deployment architecture

## How to Run

### Quick Start (One Command)
```bash
cd demo
./run_demo.sh
```

### Step by Step
```bash
cd demo
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
python run_demo.py
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
cd demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python marketplace_demo.py
```

## Expected Demo Duration

- **Setup**: 2-3 minutes (Docker image building)
- **Demo Execution**: 10-15 minutes (interactive with explanations)
- **Total Time**: 12-18 minutes

## What You'll See

1. **Environment Setup**: Docker images built, server started, users created
2. **Agent Registration**: 3 agents registered with metadata and pricing
3. **Customer Discovery**: Browse marketplace with enhanced information
4. **Instance Creation**: Customer-specific instances with Docker containers
5. **Task Execution**: Real tasks with category-specific processing
6. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Resource usage, health, and billing tracking
7. **Pause/Resume**: Cost-saving functionality demonstration
8. **Termination**: Graceful shutdown with final billing
9. **Deregistration**: Safe agent removal process
10. **Customer Dashboard**: Usage statistics and cost analytics

## Success Criteria

This demo validates that the AgentHub marketplace provides:

‚úÖ **Complete agent lifecycle management** (all 8 stages working)
‚úÖ **Docker-based agent deployment** with ACP protocol
