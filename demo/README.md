## Technical Details

### Architecture Demonstrated

- **AgentHub Server**: FastAPI-based marketplace server
- **Docker Manager**: Container lifecycle management
- **ACP Protocol**: Agent Communication Protocol with WebSocket/HTTP
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Complete 8-stage lifecycle tracking
- **Database**: SQLite with agent, customer, and instance data
- **CLI Interface**: Customer management commands

### Agent Implementation

Each demo agent includes:
- **FastAPI Server**: REST API endpoints
- **ACP Support**: Protocol handshake, task execution, heartbeat
- **Category-Specific Processing**: Realistic simulation of different agent types
- **Health Monitoring**: Status reporting and error handling
- **Docker Integration**: Environment variables and container management

### Real-Time Features

- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, network usage tracking
- **Health Checks**: Connection status and heartbeat monitoring
- **Billing Updates**: Real-time cost calculation and tracking
- **Instance Management**: Pause/resume/terminate with state management

## Interactive Elements

The demo pauses between each stage, allowing you to:
- **Read Output**: Understand what's happening at each step
- **See Results**: View actual task execution results
- **Monitor Resources**: Observe real resource usage
- **Track Costs**: See billing calculations in real-time

## Cleanup

The demo automatically cleans up:
- **Docker Containers**: Stops and removes all created containers
- **Docker Images**: Leaves images for potential reuse
- **Database**: Preserves demo database (`demo_agenthub.db`) for inspection
- **Server Process**: Gracefully shuts down the AgentHub server

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Start Docker service
   sudo systemctl start docker  # Linux
   # Or start Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac
   ```

2. **Permission Denied (Docker)**
   ```bash
   # Add user to docker group (Linux)
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   # Log out and back in
   ```

3. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using port 8080
   lsof -i :8080
   # Kill the process or use a different port
   ```

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Demo Logs

The demo creates several log files:
- Server logs in the console output
- Agent container logs accessible via `docker logs`
- Database file: `demo_agenthub.db`

## Extending the Demo

You can modify the demo to:
- **Add More Agents**: Create additional agent types
- **Change Pricing**: Modify pricing models and costs
- **Custom Tasks**: Add different task types and parameters
- **More Customers**: Create additional customer scenarios
- **Advanced Features**: Add auto-scaling, load balancing

## API Testing

While the demo runs, you can also test the API directly:

```bash
# Discover agents
curl "http://localhost:8080/marketplace/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_alice_12345678"

# Create instance
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/marketplace/instances" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_alice_12345678" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "your-agent-id", "instance_config": {}}'

# Execute task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/marketplace/instances/your-instance-id/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_alice_12345678" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"endpoint": "/process", "parameters": {"data": "test"}}'
```
